				<p><span>How the ODekh Service works</span>
				ODekh is an online book rental service that allows its users to rent books through its website located at <a href="">www.ODekh.com</a> by paying Initial Payable and charging rent 
				after return of books in Good Condition.</p>
				<p>To use ODekh™ a subscriber will have to register with <a href="">www.ODekh.com</a> to create an account. The subscriber can then browse/search books that he/she would like 
				to read, and add them to his/her Bookshelf. Once payment has been received or we have made an arrangement with the subscriber to pick up the payment at the time of 
				delivery, the selected books will be delivered to the subscriber at the shipping address provided at the time of registration as per service availability of ODekh in the given 
				pincode. Once the subscriber has finished reading the book, he/she can visit <a href="">www.ODekh.com</a> and navigate to the "Bookshelf" tab and ask for a Pick up of Books. ODekh™ will pick up the books from the subscriber’s shipping address and 
				refund the balance amount after charging rent in full once the books are returned in condition acceptable to ODekh. The right to accept or reject the acceptance of the 
				book in the condition is entirely reserved by ODekh based on their quality standards.</p>
				<p><span>International Access</span>
				This Site may be accessed from countries other than India. The delivery of books on rent / rental services are currently available, only in India. Users from other countries other 
				than India are free to register, browse, write reviews and use other features of this site as well as rent books in addresses in India. If you access and use this Site outside India 
				you are responsible for complying with your local laws and regulations.</p>
				<p><span>User</span>
				Upon becoming an ODekh™ subscriber, subscribers become responsible for paying rental fees according to the then current billing and rental terms. The rental fees is non-
				refundable.</p>
				<p><span>Automatically Sold</span>
				The book rented by Subscriber is considered sold automatically once the available rental duration of that particular book expires and thereafter ODekh will not be liable for 
				any refund from the Initial Payable.</p>
				<p><span>Billing</span>
				By using the ODekh™ service, you are expressly agreeing that we are permitted to bill you rental fee, any applicable taxes and any other charges you may incur in 
				connection with your use of the ODekh™ service. Additional charges may include books you fail to return, books you damage or a change in rental structure. As used in 
				these Terms of Service, "billing" shall indicate either a charge or debit, as applicable, against your Payment Method. The Initial Payable will be kept for issue of the book and 
				the rental fee will be billed on returning the book in good condition. All fees and charges are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. We 
				may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will give you notice of these changes by email.
				In case the books are not returned during the available rental period, the book will be considered sold and no refund on account of Initial Payable will be made.</p>
				<p><span>Cancellation</span>
				Your can cancel an order for issue of books by calling or emailing ODekh™ customer service before the book is shipped by ODekh. In any discrepancy, 
				ODekh reserves complete rights to decide whether to cancel the order or charge the Subscriber as per the rental structure. We do not provide refunds or credits for any 
				partial-month periods and charges are strictly as per rental structure defined.</p>
				<p>ODekh™ reserves the right to cancel your membership without prior notice and without assigning any reasons.</p>
				<p><span>Refunds</span>
				Upon cancellation of membership, we will refund any dues after ensuring all outstanding charges applicable have been processed and all books you rented are returned as per 
				rental period and in good condition solely decided by ODekh. The Subscriber may give his/her choice for mode of refund. However ODekh reserves the right to decide 
				the mode of refund and the Subscriber will abide by it.</p>
				<p><span>Shipping Policy</span>

				ODekh™ handles shipping using our own delivery agents, or in partnership with a logistics provider. Within NCR/Delhi we will attempt to fulfill the delivery request within 2 
				business days of receiving a delivery request from the subscriber. Please note that our guarantee is on the book title, not book copy. That is, if you request for a particular book, 
				we will send you the copy that is currently in stock. This may or may not correspond with the publisher, book image or publishing date that you have selected. If you wish to only 
				be delivered the book copy that you have selected, please send an email to our customer service. This will however, lower the probability of you getting the books and 
				the Initial Payable and the rental structure may change based on it.</p>
				<p><span>Damaged Books</span>
				All books sent to a subscriber are verified to be in a good condition prior to dispatch and condition of each book is recorded in our system. Upon receipt of the books, you must 
				ensure that the books are in good condition. Any damage, if found, must be reported to our representative and conveyed to ODekh™ customer service via email. Upon 
				receipt of the books, we will verify the condition of the book against the condition recorded in our system before dispatch.
				If a book is returned to ODekh™ damaged as a result of subscriber misuse, ODekh™ will charge you the market value of each damaged book or the Initial 
				Payable solely decided by ODekh. If ODekh™ determines that a book was damaged during transit, ODekh™ will not charge subscriber for the damaged book.</p>
				<p><span>Typographical Errors</span>
				In the event a product is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to typographical error or error in pricing or product information received from our suppliers, 
				ODekh™ shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for product listed at the incorrect price. ODekh™ shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such 
				orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and the payment made. If the payment has already been made for the purchase and your order is cancelled, 
				ODekh™ shall reverse the payment or make the refund initiated in 7 business days.</p>
				<p><span>Ongoing Membership</span>
				Your ODekh™ membership will continue in effect unless you cancel your membership or we terminate it. We will bill the rental fees plus any applicable tax to the 
				Payment Method you select during registration (or specify later). You must cancel your membership upon return of all books you rented.</p>
				<p><span>Special Offers</span>
				Special offers, if any, are available only for first-time ODekh™ subscribers, unless otherwise expressly stated in the offer. ODekh reserves right to introduce any offer 
				or cancel any ongoing offer for all or individual users without any notice in any form.</p>
